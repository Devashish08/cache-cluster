Of course! This is a phenomenal way to learn. Building from first principles is how you gain deep, lasting knowledge. Here is a detailed, phased project plan designed specifically for learning, complete with tasks and recommended readings for each stage.

### Project: "Go-Cache-Cluster"

**Core Philosophy:** Build each component yourself where feasible to understand the mechanics before reaching for a library. We will focus on the *why* behind each architectural decision.

---

### Phase 0: Foundations & Setup

This phase is about setting up your environment and understanding the core Go concepts you'll rely on heavily.

**Objective:** Prepare a clean project structure and refresh your understanding of Go's concurrency primitives.

**Tasks:**
1.  **Project Setup:**
    *   Create a new directory for your project.
    *   Initialize a Go module: `go mod init github.com/your-username/go-cache-cluster`.
    *   Create a basic directory structure:
        ```
        /go-cache-cluster
        ├── cmd/
        │   └── server/       # Main application entry point
        │       └── main.go
        ├── internal/         # All your core logic will go here
        │   ├── cache/        # The cache engine itself (Phase 1)
        │   ├── cluster/      # Clustering, hashing, peers (Phase 3+)
        │   └── server/       # API handlers (Phase 2)
        └── pkg/              # Code to be shared with clients (Phase 6)
            └── client/
        ```
2.  **Concurrency Primer:** Write a few small, throwaway programs to practice:
    *   Using `sync.Mutex` to protect a simple `map`.
    *   Using `sync.RWMutex` and observing how it allows concurrent reads.
    *   Launching a background task with a `goroutine` that can be gracefully shut down using a `context`.

**Learning Focus & First Principles:**
*   **Project Structuring:** How to organize code for maintainability and clear separation of concerns.
*   **Concurrency vs. Parallelism:** The fundamental concepts.
*   **Race Conditions:** What they are and why you must protect shared state.
*   **Mutual Exclusion:** The role of Mutexes (`sync.Mutex`, `sync.RWMutex`) in ensuring safe concurrent access to data.

**Recommended Readings:**
*   **Theory:** The concept of "Race Conditions" and "Critical Sections" in operating systems.
*   **Go Specific:**
    *   [A Tour of Go - Concurrency](https://go.dev/tour/concurrency/1) (If you're new to it).
    *   [Go's `sync` package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/sync). Pay close attention to `Mutex` and `RWMutex`.
    *   [Dave Cheney - Go Concurrency is not Parallelism](https://dave.cheney.net/2014/03/19/golang-concurrency-is-not-parallelism).

### Phase 1: The Core Cache Engine (A Stand-alone Node)

**Objective:** Build a single, thread-safe, in-memory cache with LRU eviction and TTL support.

**Tasks:**
1.  **LRU Data Structure:** Inside `internal/cache/`, create a `Cache` struct.
    *   It will contain a `map[string]*list.Element` for O(1) lookups.
    *   It will contain a `list.List` (from `container/list`) for O(1) ordering updates.
    *   Add a `sync.RWMutex` for thread safety.
2.  **Implement Core Methods:**
    *   `NewCache(capacity int) *Cache`: Constructor.
    *   `Set(key string, value []byte, ttl time.Duration)`: Adds an item. If capacity is full, it must evict the least recently used item. It also stores the expiration time.
    *   `Get(key string) ([]byte, bool)`: Retrieves an item. If found, it must move the item to the front of the list (marking it as recently used).
    *   `Delete(key string)`: Removes an item.
3.  **Implement TTL Expiry:**
    *   In your `Value` struct (which will be the data stored in the linked list), add an `expiresAt` timestamp (`time.Time`).
    *   When you create the cache, launch a background goroutine that runs periodically (e.g., every second).
    *   This goroutine will lock the cache and iterate through items, deleting any that have expired.

**Learning Focus & First Principles:**
*   **Data Structures:** The classic implementation of an LRU cache. Why a hash map + doubly linked list gives you O(1) performance for both `Get` and `Set`.
*   **Concurrency Control:** Practical application of `RWMutex` to maximize performance in a read-heavy system.
*   **Background Processes:** Using goroutines for cleanup tasks and the importance of graceful shutdown.

**Recommended Readings:**
*   **Theory:** Any good data structures article or video explaining the LRU Cache algorithm.
*   **Go Specific:**
    *   [Go's `container/list` package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/container/list). Understand how `MoveToFront` and `Remove` work.
    *   [Go's `time` package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/time) for handling TTLs.

---

### Phase 2: Going Networked (API Layer)

**Objective:** Expose the cache engine over the network using gRPC.

**Tasks:**
1.  **Define the API with Protobuf:**
    *   Create a `.proto` file (e.g., `api/v1/cache.proto`).
    *   Define a `CacheService` with RPCs like `Get`, `Set`, `Delete`.
    *   Define the request and response messages.
    *   Generate the Go code from the `.proto` file.
2.  **Implement the Server:**
    *   In `internal/server/`, create a `grpcServer` struct that holds your `cache` instance from Phase 1.
    *   Implement the `CacheService` interface you just generated. The implementations will simply call the methods on your `cache` instance.
    *   In `cmd/server/main.go`, instantiate your cache and your gRPC server, and start listening for connections.
3.  **Create a Simple Test Client:** Write a separate, small `main.go` file somewhere that acts as a gRPC client to connect to your server and test the `Get` and `Set` calls.

**Learning Focus & First Principles:**
*   **Client-Server Model:** The fundamental architecture of network services.
*   **RPC (Remote Procedure Call):** The concept of calling a function on a remote machine as if it were local. Contrast this mentally with REST/HTTP.
*   **Serialization/Deserialization:** How data structures are converted to a byte stream (and back) for network transmission. The efficiency benefits of Protobuf over JSON.
*   **API Design & Schemas:** The importance of a well-defined contract between client and server.

**Recommended Readings:**
*   **Theory:** [An Introduction to gRPC](https://www.grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/) and articles comparing RPC vs. REST.
*   **Go Specific:**
    *   The official [gRPC Go Quickstart](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/). This will walk you through everything from `proto` files to server/client implementation.

---

### Phase 3: The "Distributed" in Distributed Cache

**Objective:** Distribute keys across multiple cache nodes using consistent hashing.

**Tasks:**
1.  **Implement Consistent Hashing:**
    *   In `internal/cluster/`, create a `Ring` or `ConsistentHash` struct.
    *   Implement `AddNode(nodeAddress string)` which adds a node's hash to a sorted list/slice.
    *   Implement `GetNode(key string)` which hashes the key and finds the first node on the ring with a hash greater than or equal to the key's hash.
2.  **Integrate with the Server:**
    *   Your `grpcServer` now needs to be aware of all peers in the cluster and have a `ConsistentHash` ring instance.
    *   Modify your API handlers (`Get`, `Set`, `Delete`):
        *   When a request comes in for a key, use the consistent hash ring to determine which node *should* own the key.
        *   **If `currentNode == ownerNode`**: Handle the request locally (as you do now).
        *   **If `currentNode != ownerNode`**: Forward the request. Use a gRPC client (within the server) to send the *exact same request* to the correct owner node and return its response to the original caller.
3.  **Bootstrap the Cluster:** For now, use a simple command-line flag or config file to pass a list of all peer addresses to each node on startup.

**Learning Focus & First Principles:**
*   **Distributed Hashing:** Why simple `hash(key) % N` is flawed (massive re-shuffling).
*   **Consistent Hashing:** The algorithm that minimizes key remapping when nodes join or leave. Understand the concept of the "hash ring".
*   **Request Routing/Forwarding:** How a node in a distributed system acts as both a server and a client to its peers.

**Recommended Readings:**
*   **Theory:**
    *   [The original Consistent Hashing paper by Karger et al.](http://www.karger.org/downloads/papers/chash.pdf) (Academic but foundational).
    *   [A visual, high-level explanation of Consistent Hashing](https://www.toptal.com/big-data/consistent-hashing) (Highly recommended).
*   **Go Specific:** You'll be building this mostly from Go fundamentals (slices, sorting, hash functions like `crc32`). Reading a few existing Go implementations on GitHub can provide good structural patterns.

---

### Phase 4: Robustness - Replication & Membership

**Objective:** Make the cluster fault-tolerant by replicating data and enabling nodes to discover each other dynamically.

**Tasks:**
1.  **Data Replication:**
    *   Modify your consistent hashing implementation to return `N` nodes for a key (the primary owner and its `N-1` successors on the ring).
    *   Modify your `Set` and `Delete` handlers:
        *   The receiving node (the coordinator for the request) sends the write operation to all `N` replicas.
        *   Start with asynchronous replication for simplicity: fire off the requests in separate goroutines and don't wait for them to complete before responding to the client. This prioritizes availability (AP in CAP).
2.  **Cluster Membership:**
    *   **Start simple (Coordinator-based):**
        *   Designate one node as a "coordinator" via a startup flag.
        *   Have other nodes register with the coordinator on startup.
        *   The coordinator maintains the list of live nodes and periodically broadcasts this full list to all members.
    *   **Advanced goal (Gossip):** Replace the coordinator with a gossip protocol. Have each node periodically pick a few random peers and exchange their known member lists, converging on a shared view of the cluster over time.

**Learning Focus & First Principles:**
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The concept of designing systems that can withstand component failures.
*   **CAP Theorem:** Understand the trade-offs between Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. Your asynchronous replication model is a classic "AP" system.
*   **Data Consistency Models:** Eventual Consistency vs. Strong Consistency.
*   **Service Discovery:** How services find each other in a dynamic environment.

**Recommended Readings:**
*   **Theory:**
    *   **The Amazon DynamoDB Paper:** [Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf). This is a **MUST READ**. It covers consistent hashing, replication, versioning (vector clocks), and failure handling in a real-world system that inspired countless others.
    *   [An Explanation of the CAP Theorem](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Y2_cf-v6o) (or any good article).
*   **Implementation Example:** [HashiCorp's memberlist library](https://github.com/hashicorp/memberlist). You don't need to use it, but reading their documentation on the SWIM gossip protocol they implemented is highly educational.

---

### Phase 5: Production Readiness - Observability

**Objective:** Instrument the service so you can understand its performance and behavior under load.

**Tasks:**
1.  **Metrics:**
    *   Integrate the official Prometheus Go client library.
    *   Create metrics:
        *   A `Counter` for cache hits and misses.
        *   A `Gauge` for the total number of items in the cache.
        *   A `Histogram` to measure the latency of `Get` and `Set` requests.
    *   Expose these metrics on a separate HTTP endpoint (e.g., `:8081/metrics`).
2.  **Structured Logging:**
    *   Integrate Go's standard `slog` library (Go 1.21+).
    *   Go through your code and replace all `fmt.Println` or `log.Println` calls with structured logs. E.g., `slog.Info("successfully set key", "key", "my-key", "node", "node-1")`.

**Learning Focus & First Principles:**
*   **The Three Pillars of Observability:** Metrics, Logs, and Traces.
*   **Monitoring vs. Observability:** Understanding the difference.
*   **Metric Types:** When to use a Counter, Gauge, Histogram, or Summary.
*   **Structured vs. Unstructured Logging:** Why key-value pair logs are vastly superior for querying and analysis.

**Recommended Readings:**
*   **Go Specific:**
    *   [Prometheus docs: Instrumenting a Go application](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/go-application/).
    *   [Go's `slog` package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog).

### Phase 6: Final Touches - Client SDK & Persistence

**Objective:** Create a user-friendly client library and add a basic persistence mechanism.

**Tasks:**
1.  **Client SDK (`/pkg/client`):**
    *   Create a new client package. This client will be "smart".
    *   It should take the list of initial nodes, instantiate its *own* consistent hashing ring, and keep it updated (e.g., by fetching the member list from one of the nodes).
    *   When the user calls `client.Get("mykey")`, the client calculates the correct node itself and connects directly to it, avoiding the extra network hop of a redirect.
2.  **Command-Line Tool (CLI):**
    *   In a new `cmd/cli` directory, use a library like `cobra` to build a simple CLI (`go-cache-cli set <key> <value>`, `go-cache-cli get <key>`) that uses your new client SDK.
3.  **Persistence (Optional but great learning):**
    *   Implement one of these:
        *   **Snapshotting:** Add a method to the cache engine that iterates over all items and writes them to a file. Add logic to load this file on startup.
        *   **Append-Only File (AOF):** Create a log file. Every time a `Set` or `Delete` is performed, append the command to this file. On startup, replay the commands from the log to rebuild the cache state.

**Learning Focus & First Principles:**
*   **Client-Side Load Balancing:** Shifting routing intelligence from the server to the client.
*   **API Abstraction:** Creating an easy-to-use library that hides complex internal logic.
*   **Durability & Persistence:** Strategies for making volatile in-memory data survive restarts.

**Recommended Readings:**
*   **Go Specific:** The `cobra` library's documentation is excellent for building CLIs. Redis's documentation on its AOF and RDB persistence models provides great insight into the trade-offs.

By following this plan, you won't just have a "project," you'll have gone on a comprehensive tour of the fundamental principles of building reliable distributed systems. Good luck, and have fun building
